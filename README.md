## About myself

Hi! I'm TuongCoffee. You can call me Tuong.  
I'm a beginner programmer, born in 2014, and from Vietnam.

### How did I learn about programming?

It's a ***long*** story.

So… umm… for real, I **started learning coding** when I was **around 11 or 12**.  
At that time, I wanted to experiment with scripts in Roblox <sub>( lol )</sub>, so I started researching things like *"how Roblox scripts work"*.  

I discovered platforms like **Happymod** — a place that contains *safe-modded* apps and games (*NOT SPONSORED*).  
I tried Roblox mods, but they weren’t very good, so I kept searching until I found script executors like *Delta*, *Fluxus*, and *Krnl* that could run scripts inside the Roblox client.

Running scripts I found on *YouTube* and *Google* was really fun.  
Also, I want to clarify that I was **experimenting with scripts**, not hacking. I only used them to make others laugh, not to ruin anyone’s experience.

After that journey, I started thinking:  
*"Why not make my own script?"*

That’s when I began learning scripting and programming — and I **fell in love with it**.  
The first language I learned was **Luau**, a scripting language used in Roblox.

At first, my scripts weren’t very good, and I sometimes used **ChatGPT** to help write code.  
Eventually, I stopped learning for a while due to personal limitations.

That’s it. <sub>The end.</sub>  
Thanks for readi— just kidding, it’s not over yet.

## About this repository

### Why did I make this repository?

Just for fun :)

#### 1. Learning to script

This repository was created to learn scripting using multiple programming languages, mainly `.ts` or `.js` (JvaScript or TypeScript), with the help of **ChatGPT**.  
I don’t currently have a teacher to guide me, so I use ChatGPT to learn, practice, and improve my **skills** step by step.

#### 2. Making stuff

This repository also stores some of my work so others can use it too.  
Please give **credit** if you reuse any part of my work.

#### 3. For testing scripts

This repository includes lists, arrays, and other data used for testing scripts.  
For example, if you want to write a script that fetches or processes data from the Internet, this repository can be useful.

### What’s in this repository?

This repository contains a lot of scripts created throughout my *learning journey*.  
The code reflects my process of *learning*, *experimenting*, and *improving* my understanding of scripting over time.
